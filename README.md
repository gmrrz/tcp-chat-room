This project is for my Computer Networks class. Here I am implementing:

- TCP protocol because it is way more reliable for the chat application.
- Raspberry Pi as server.
- Encryption of the messages, so they can be securely sent, using cryptography.
- Multi-client support so multiple users can connect to the chat server at once.
- Tracking of the performance by logging it and analyzing latency and packet flow using Wireshark.
